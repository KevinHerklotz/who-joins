# Who joins

A side project for my football team with the main purpose of learning Next.js.

## Local development

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Linting

For linting and fromatting this project uses Prettier, ESLint and stylesint.
It is very much recommended to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), because it will auto format/fix all your code automatically for you once you save a file.
In order for that to work you need to install the following plugins:

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

If you don't use VSCode you could also use the command `yarn format:all`.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
